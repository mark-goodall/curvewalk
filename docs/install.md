# Installation

Curvewalk is available as a package on PyPI and can be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install curvewalk
```

Alternatively, you can install it directly from the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mark-goodall/curvewalk
cd curvewalk
pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, you can add the dependency to your own projects `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`

It currently has no dependencies, but this may change in the future if necessary. There are a number test dependencies, however, such as pytest and numpy.
